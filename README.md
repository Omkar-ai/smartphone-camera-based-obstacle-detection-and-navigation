A blind person walking in an unfamiliar environment faces many problems, this issue may be of identifying true obstacle or may be of identifying potholes, bumps in his way. In past few years, different types of ETA's have been developed for helping visually impaired people. Regardless of various ETA's available, they are still not affordable to the majority of blind people. And most of these ETA's only focuses on only one problem i.e. either pot-hole detection or obstacle in front of the user. Apart from that, they do not provide information about the environment in which user is present. This paper describes a real-time system which makes use of the ultrasonic sensor, camera, and smartphone for detection, recognition and processing of objects that hinders the path of visually impaired person. Ultrasonic sensors detect and measure the distance of obstacle while image captured from a camera is used for object recognition. The output given to the user is in the form of vibration and audio. The intensity of the output depends on the distance of an object from the user.
This paper introduces a novel approach using smartphone technology to aid visually impaired individuals in detecting and navigating obstacles in their surroundings. Visual impairment presents significant challenges to everyday mobility and independence. Existing solutions often rely on specialized hardware or expensive systems, limiting accessibility. Leveraging the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, this proposed system capitalizes on their computational power, sensors, and camera capabilities to provide real-time obstacle detection and alert mechanisms.The system employs computer vision algorithms to process live camera feed and identify obstacles within the environment. Machine learning models are utilized to classify objects, hazards, and impediments in the userâ€™s path. Upon detection, the system provides audio or haptic feedback to the user, alerting them to the presence and location of obstacles, enabling timely adjustments in navigation.Furthermore, the system incorporates GPS and mapping functionalities to offer additional information on the user's surroundings, aiding in route planning and navigation. The combination of real-time obstacle detection with mapping services enhances the user's ability to navigate unfamiliar or dynamic environments with increased confidence.The design focuses on user-friendly interfaces, considering the diverse needs and abilities of visually impaired individuals. It aims to be intuitive, customizable, and adaptable to different user preferences and environmental conditions.
